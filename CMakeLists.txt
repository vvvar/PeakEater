# Example Audio Plugin CMakeLists.txt

# To get started on a new plugin, copy this entire folder (containing this file and C++ sources) to
# a convenient location, and then start making modifications.

# The first line of any CMake project should be a call to `cmake_minimum_required`, which checks
# that the installed CMake will be able to understand the following CMakeLists, and ensures that
# CMake's behaviour is compatible with the named version. This is a standard CMake command, so more
# information can be found in the CMake docs.

cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.15)

# The top-level CMakeLists.txt file for a project must contain a literal, direct call to the
# `project()` command. `project()` sets up some helpful variables that describe source/binary
# directories, and the current project version. This is a standard CMake command.

project(PeakEater VERSION 0.3.0)

# If you've installed JUCE somehow (via a package manager, or directly using the CMake install
# target), you'll need to tell this project that it depends on the installed copy of JUCE. If you've
# included JUCE directly in your source tree (perhaps as a submodule), you'll need to tell CMake to
# include that subdirectory as part of the build.

# find_package(JUCE CONFIG REQUIRED)        # If you've installed JUCE to your system
# or
add_subdirectory(Dependencies/JUCE)         # If you've put JUCE in a subdirectory called JUCE

# If you are building a VST2 or AAX plugin, CMake needs to be told where to find these SDKs on your
# system. This setup should be done before calling `juce_add_plugin`.

# juce_set_vst2_sdk_path(...)
# juce_set_aax_sdk_path(...)

# `juce_add_plugin` adds a static library target with the name passed as the first argument
# (AudioPluginExample here). This target is a normal CMake target, but has a lot of extra properties set
# up by default. As well as this shared code static library, this function adds targets for each of
# the formats specified by the FORMATS arguments. This function accepts many optional arguments.
# Check the readme at `docs/CMake API.md` in the JUCE repo for the full list.

# `juce_generate_juce_header` will create a JuceHeader.h for a given target, which will be generated
# into your build tree. This should be included with `#include <JuceHeader.h>`. The include path for
# this header will be automatically added to the target. The main function of the JuceHeader is to
# include all your JUCE module headers; if you're happy to include module headers directly, you
# probably don't need to call this.

# `target_sources` adds source files to a target. We pass the target that needs the sources as the

# `target_compile_definitions` adds some preprocessor definitions to our target. In a Projucer
